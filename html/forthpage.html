                Audiomack may increase the price of subscriptions due to a variety of reasons, including, but not
                limited to; changing market conditions, competitor pricing, and licensing agreements with content
                partners.</p><br>
            <p>If you have a Subscription and your account is suspended or terminated by Audiomack due to infringing
                upon Audiomack’s terms of service, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unexpired period of
                your subscription. If your account is terminated because Audiomack elects to cease providing access to
                the platform in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the
                platform, or in other reasonable circumstances as determined by Audiomack at its discretion, refunds may
                be payable at the reasonable discretion of Audiomack. Audiomack has no liability to you, nor any
                obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures
                that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our
                control.</p><br>

            <h1>Audiomack Supporters Program – Listener Terms</h1>
            <p>Audiomack’s Supporters program (the “Program”) enables you to support Artists through the purchase of
                digital tokens (“Tokens”), which you can use to show your appreciation for a particular track or album
                (“Project”) on the Audiomack Service or Platform (as defined in the Audiomack Terms of Service). Tokens
                include a badge that you can include on your Audiomack profile, and/or an image of the Project artwork
                that you can share via your other social media profiles and channels, in each case demonstrating your
                support for the relevant Project. Audiomack intends to share revenue from purchase of Tokens with
                applicable Artists.</p><br>
            <p>If you choose to purchase or use Tokens, these Terms apply to you. These Terms may change from time to
                time. We will notify you of any significant changes by email, but we also recommend you review this page
                periodically to make sure you’re aware of the latest Terms.</p><br>
            <p>The Program is only open to certain Artists on the Audiomack Service and Platform, as determined by us at
                our discretion. For this reason, you may not always be able to buy Tokens for every Artist or Project
                that you may wish to support.</p><br>
            <p> You can purchase Tokens if you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your
                jurisdiction), or if you are at least 13 years of age and are acting under the supervision of a parent
                or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms.</p><br>
            <p>Using Tokens to support an Artist’s Project does not give you any rights with respect to that Project.
            </p><br>
            <p>Audiomack intends to share the revenue generated from the sale of Tokens with applicable Artists and/or
                their representatives under the terms of agreements that Audiomack has entered into with those Artists
                and/or their representatives. Audiomack may retain a share of this revenue for itself, and may also be
                required to share revenue with certain third-party platform providers under the terms of agreements with
                those third-party platform providers. For this reason, Audiomack cannot guarantee that the money you
                spend on Tokens will be shared exclusively with the specific Artists whose Projects you choose to
                support using your Tokens.</p><br>
            <p>We may change or withdraw the Program at any time at our sole discretion, and subject to applicable law,
                we will not be obligated to refund the value of any Tokens, or otherwise be liable to you in any way, if
                we do so. Please bear this in mind when deciding whether to purchase Tokens, or how many Tokens you wish
                to purchase at any given time. We may also introduce or discontinue different types of Token or change
                the price of Tokens at any time, although this will not affect any Tokens you have already purchased.
            </p><br>
            <p>The price of Tokens will be provided at the time of purchase. All charges and payments for Tokens will be
                made in the currency specified at the time of purchase. Currency exchange settlements, foreign
                transaction fees and payment channel fees, if any, are based on your agreement with the applicable
                payment provider.</p><br>
            <p>All sales of Tokens are final. Tokens are non-refundable, except as required by applicable law. Tokens
                are available to be used as soon as your payment is processed, and by purchasing Tokens, you agree that
                you will waive any statutory right you may have to change your mind about your purchase, or to cancel
                your purchase within any applicable cooling off period.</p><br>
            <p>The associated value of the Tokens that you purchase will be credited to your Audiomack account. If you
                choose to support a Project using your Token(s), the associated value of the Token(s) will be deducted
                from your Audiomack account. This deduction is final, and you will not be entitled to reverse or cancel
                your support, or claim any refund or credit, for example, if you choose to delete any post featuring
                your Token on any third party platform.</p><br>
            <p>If any Tokens are subject to sales tax in your jurisdiction and you have not paid the applicable sales
                tax to us when you purchase your Tokens, then you will be responsible for the payment of the applicable
                sales tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority.</p><br>
            <p>Tokens do not constitute property, and have no monetary value. Tokens are not currency, and do not
                constitute cash or cash equivalent. Tokens cannot be exchanged for cash or other goods or services.
                Tokens cannot be transferred to or exchanged with other users, and other than any Token designed for
                social sharing via third party platforms, cannot be used outside of the Audiomack Service or Platform.
            </p><br>
            <p>Purchase and use of Tokens requires you to have an Audiomack account. If you delete your account for any
                reason, if you permanently lose access to your account, or if your account is terminated pursuant to the
                Audiomack Terms of Service, you will not be able to purchase Tokens and you will lose access to any
                Tokens you may already have purchased. We will not be liable for any refunds in respect of any unused
                Tokens in these cases.</p><br>
            <p>Without limiting any of our other rights, we may prevent you from purchasing or using Tokens if you
                breach any of these Terms, or breach any provision of the Audiomack Terms of Service.</p><br>
            <p>These Terms govern your purchase and use of Tokens and are supplemental to the Audiomack Terms of Service
                and other terms, conditions and policies governing your use of the Audiomack Service or Platform. Your
                purchase of Tokens may also be subject to additional third party terms, for example relating to in-app
                purchases, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that you read, understand, and comply with
                applicable third party terms. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Audiomack Terms
                of Service, these Terms will govern solely with respect to the Program, and solely to the extent of that
                conflict.</p><br>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms or the Program, you can contact us at <a
